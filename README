This is the repository for the source code of my personal space on the net [thierry.ducrest.net](http://thierry.ducrest.net)

It used to be a single page site, but since september 2016 I am using [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) a static site generator written in Python. Hoping to start blogging a little.
